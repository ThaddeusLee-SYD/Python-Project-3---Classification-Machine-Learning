# Python-Project-3---Classification-Machine-Learning

This is the second assignment for Practical Python for Data Science which formed part of my Graduate Certificate in Data Science.

For this assignment, the goal was to create a solution for a telecommunications company that would accurately classify sms texts received by customers as either legitimate, or spam.

The attached power point presentation provides an intro, explanation of the data, and the steps taken to tidy and prepare the data using tokenisation, identifying stop words.

An overview of the K nearest neighbours and decision trees is provided. Parameters are chosen using grid search and the performance and accuracy of each data model is evaluated and compared.
